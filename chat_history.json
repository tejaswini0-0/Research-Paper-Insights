The study likely involved a combination of analytical methods, including:\n\n1. Literature review: The text cites existing research, such as Tanaka et al. (2008), indicating a thorough review of existing literature on food colorants and their analysis.\n2. Experimental research: The mention of biopreservation approaches, such as the use of lytic bacteriophages, lactic acid bacteria, and bacteriocins, suggests that experimental studies were conducted to test the effectiveness of these methods.\n3. Sensory and hedonic research: The study explored the psychological impact of food color on flavor perception, which likely involved sensory testing and surveys to understand individual differences in taste preferences and expectations.\n\nHowever, the text does not provide detailed information on the specific methodology used in the study, such as the sample size, data collection methods, or statistical analysis techniques.",
